# Problematic Internet Use

## Course Project for CS 334: Principles and Techniques of Data Science

Problematic Internet Use by the Child Mind Institute is a Kaggle Competition for predicting the level of problematic internet usage exhibited by children and adolescents, based on their physical activity, fitness data and other demographic indicators. At the end of this project, we will hopefully have developed a predictive model to identify early signs of problematic internet use. Identifying these patterns can help trigger interventions to encourage healthier digital habits.

If you would like to run the notebooks yourself, please ensure you have the folder `series_train.parquet` present within the directory, as that contains time-series data for each participant that wore an accelerometer. This folder is not part of this repository as the files are too large. You can download the entire dataset from Kaggle.
